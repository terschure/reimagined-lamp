# Design
The main aim of this visualisation is to show that almost everything on earth is interconnected. Therefore it is important to show a complete overview of the data, followed by a more detailed view.

#### Minimum viable product
In order to show the vastness of the dataset and the interdependency of all living things a complete network map is needed as the chaos of it tells part of the story. In order for the user to be able to explore the more specific interactions it is important that there is a possibility to select and filter the data. Therefore, the minimum viable product is a webpage with a single network map that highlights subsections and shows species names on hovering.

#### Usability
The main focus for the user interaction is the use of filters. However, there are also some other options to enhance the user experience and their options of exploring the data.
Toggling between the proposed network map and for instance a chord diagram may enhance the users ability to find patterns in the data. This may be further enhanced by grouping the species data according to their taxonomy as it may well be that there are striking patterns of interactions between the groups. The species and interactions are both color-coded so for the optimal user experience it is important to have a legend. Furthermore, as the dataset is based on only scientific research, it is of some relevance to also depict the absolute number of interactions and be able to search through the dataset using a search field. In order to give the user some insight into the different species it may be a good idea to provide them with some facts in a detail-window.
