Who eats who? And how do these animals, plants, fungi or bacteria relate? This visualisation shines a light on different types of biotic interactions and consequently shows how everything and everyone on earth has a vital role.

#### Many small things make something big
Animals, plants, fungi and bacteria all over the world interact in different ways and over micro-scale to global distances. Many species specific research papers on these interactions have been published, but in order to get an overview of a system of interactions, or how an ecosystem functions, it is important to combine these results into a large dataset. The second part is the translation to something more visual: to convey this data in a comprehensible manner so that is becomes possible for us to see patterns in the data, gaps in knowledge, but more importantly to grasp how ecosystems function and that every species plays an important part.

#### Functionality
One big network creates the sense that the biotic interactions data is numerous and complex, but is is limiting in the sense that you still can't actually make sense of the data. Grouping species that are alike is one step towards this goal. Others are for instance: to pan and zoom, highlight interactions of a specific species, search for a species, filter out groups of species you're not interested in, highlight only certain interactions types, etc.

#### Data
The interaction data is downloaded from the [GloBI API](https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/API#interactions) and is a result of the [Global Biotic Interactions project](http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org). This dataset contains information about the interactions of species and what of what type they are; i.e. predatory or parasitic.
